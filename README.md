# AuGit

# A revolution for Git contributions.

This is an API which uses automation to custom create Git commit messages specifically targeting any code edited or modified with appropriate and accurate narrations of said code. We will initially be supporting Java but, plan to expand to support Python and more languages in the future.

AuGit will debut with support for Java however we intend to expand support to Python and C immediately after Java.
