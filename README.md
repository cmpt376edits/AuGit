# AuGit

# A revolution for Git contributions.

This is an API which uses automation to custom create Git commit messages specifically targeting any code edited or modified with appropriate and accurate narrations of said code. We will initially be supporting Java but, plan to expand to support Python and more languages in the future. 

Not only will AuGit allow for generating smart commit messages, but with AuGit Changes you can see the differences between two files at a glance.

AuGit will debut with support for Java however we intend to expand support to Python and C immediately after Java.

# Simplifying Project Onboarding, Documentation, and Code Summary.

One of the most challengin aspects of developing software is onboarding new team members with good documentation and summaries for current classes. AuGit allows for automatic generation of such documentation and summaries from any Java code/ project legacy or not.
