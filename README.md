# AuGit

# A revolution for Git contributions.

This applicationn (AuGit -> AUtomated Git commIT) uses automation to custom create Git commit messages specifically targeting any code edited, modified, refactored, or removed with appropriate and accurate narrations of the changes made, their author, and their potential impacts. The project will initially be supporting Java but, plan to expand to support Python and more languages in the future. 

Not only will AuGit allow for generating smart commit messages, but with AuGit Changes you can see the differences between two files at a glance aiding developers in seeing changes in a clear, pragmatic manner.

# Simplifying Project Onboarding, Documentation, and Code Summary.

One of the most challenging aspects of developing software is onboarding new team members with good documentation and summaries for current classes. AuGit allows for automatic generation of such documentation and summaries from any Java code/ project legacy or not. This allows for succint summaries to be built directly from code wihout any extra efforts from development teams.

# Project Plans

In order to turn AuGit into software that people really want to use its important to constantly further development, currently my plan calls to have Java compatibility completed by the end of July, Python by September, and C by November.

# Note

Plans have shifted to try and write most of AuGit in Kotlin rather than Java as of May 30 2018.
