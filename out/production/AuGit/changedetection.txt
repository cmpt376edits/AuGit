Files here are for detecting changes in (Java) code .  .  .

The Process:

Take a commit and the branches previous head --> find the difference using Khoris difference function to pull out the differece

between the two strings --> using function detection code to create a list of function objects in our List --> detect arguments

and return types and add them to the function objects

As of May 31, several Kotlin Files have been converted over from Java. The only Kotlin file I do not plan to use immediately is FileToString.kt
