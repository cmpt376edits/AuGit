int main (int argc, char* argv){
  //code
  //roughly what we want to do is detect when a git commit is made then grab that input, 
  // once we have that we look at the currently added files and do a generate message for
  // them once we have that message we send git commit -m "<message>" to stdin and add an additional 
  // that says AuGit wrote a commit

  // Also need to consider how flags will work:
  // I would suggest -a for no args -ac for no access modifiers -c for no classes -m for no methods -co for no comments etc

  // command line arguments checking

  // check git status, grab files that have been changed
  

  // call java program

  // read java output from temp file

  // delete temp file

  // ask user if message is ok
  
  // make commit
}
